### **Competitive Landscape: Focus Bear vs. Other Productivity Apps**

### **1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**
Focus Bear stands out for its neurodiversity-focused design. Unlike general productivity tools such as Freedom or Cold Turkey that only block distractions, Focus Bear combines habit tracking, focus sessions, and guided routines to support users with ADHD and executive-function challenges. It integrates mindfulness and health breaks, offering a holistic approach rather than pure restriction.

### **2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**
I’d choose Focus Bear because it’s not just a blocker, it’s a comprehensive productivity coach. It guides me through morning routines, enforces breaks, and encourages healthy habits that support long-term focus and mental well-being. The friendly bear mascot and simple interface also make it more motivating than rigid productivity tools.

### **3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**
Apps like **Tiimo** and **Routinery** provide visual schedule customization and wearable device integration (e.g., Apple Watch reminders). Adding smartwatch notifications or syncing routines to mobile widgets could help users stay on track even when away from their computer.

### **4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**
Focus Bear could introduce a **collaborative progress-sharing feature** allowing users to share milestones with friends, mentors, or productivity coaches. This would add social accountability and make habit-building more engaging while staying aligned with the app’s supportive tone.
