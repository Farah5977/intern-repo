# CI/CD Reflection

## What is the purpose of CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) help automate testing and quality checks whenever code is changed. CI ensures that new changes integrate smoothly with the existing codebase, while CD enables reliable and consistent deployments.

## How does automating style checks improve project quality

Automated style checks such as markdown linting and spell checking ensure consistent formatting and readability across the project. They catch issues early, reduce manual review effort, and enforce shared standards.

## What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD

Strict checks can initially slow down development, especially when contributors are unfamiliar with the rules. False positives or overly strict rules may frustrate developers, and CI pipelines require ongoing maintenance.

## How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams

In small projects, CI/CD pipelines are usually simple and focus on basic checks. In large teams, pipelines are more complex, including multiple test stages, security scans, approvals, and deployment environments.
