### Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

### Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies create structured ways for the team to share updates, highlight blockers, coordinate tasks, and review progress. They reduce confusion, maintain alignment, and keep the team synchronized.

### Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?
For my role as a **Mac App Developer Intern**, **Daily Stand-ups** are the most important because:

- They help me communicate progress quickly  
- I can highlight blockers early  
- I understand what teammates are working on  
- It keeps me aligned with team expectations  

Fast feedback is key in development, so daily alignment helps me stay productive.

### Task

### Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.
I reviewed how stand-ups work: each person shares today’s progress, plan, and blockers.

### Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.
Retrospectives help teams reflect and continuously improve collaboration and workflow.

### Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
I can improve team collaboration by sharing new ideas or suggestions during retrospectives.
