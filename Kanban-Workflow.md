# Kanban Workflow

## Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps manage priorities by making the entire workflow visible. Every task is placed in a specific column (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done), making it easy to understand what needs attention.  
Kanban avoids overload by using WIP (Work-in-Progress) limits, which prevent working on too many tasks at once. This reduces multitasking, increases focus, and keeps the workflow steady and manageable.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow by:

- Breaking tasks into smaller pieces.  
- Updating task status frequently.  
- Limiting how many active tasks I work on.  
- Using "Blocked" when I'm waiting on someone.  
- Reviewing my board daily to set priorities.  
- Identifying bottlenecks and improving continuously.
